# Learning Reflections README

## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview

I had to create an Instagram profile for CodeSpace pets which would test my knowledge on CSS layouts.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: I cannot yet say that I am confident in CSS layout techniques as although i was able to use flex and grid and it somewhat imitated an Instagram profile, it was not perfect.
- **Responsive Design**: The elements are responsive on different screens, but I did not have enough time to make sure that columns would go from 3 to 1 on smaller screens.
- **Styling Elements**: I spent most of my time focussing on the layout and structure of the page.

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: I did not get to make sure that columns would go from 3 to 1 on smaller screens. This is an area where I feel that I still require more practice and research as it is currently more easier for me to use pixels.
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: I created hover effects for the profile section buttons quite easily and did not face any challenges there.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: This project was a bit of a struggle for me, and I believe that going through the notes and videos more thoroughly will help the code come to me more naturally.
- **Code Optimization**: I believe that my code could have been far more efficient, as I spent a lot of time focussing on areas that I believe there were simpler routes for.
- **Creative Design Choices**: I plan on coming back to this project to style it to perfectly mimic an Instagram page as I believe that would be fun for me while also testing my skills.

#### Overall Learning Experience

I struggled for a while to even know where to begin, there was so much to be done and it caused me to be overwhelmed. I ended up dividing the tasks, to make the Instagram layout, into smaller sections which made knowing what to do far more easier for me. It was however, frustrating to think I had done something right and look at the results and see that the code had not done what I expected it to do, and still remaining with those results after making many changes. I plan on going over the notes again and more thoroughly as I believe it will help me see where I went wrong and where I can improve.
